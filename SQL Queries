1.Comparing us movies versus international movies (by genre or budget or score?) 

SELECT Movie, Genre, Gross

SELECT Movie, Genre, Gross 
FROM MOVIE 
WHERE Country <> 'USA' 
ORDER BY Gross DESC 
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY; 

 

SELECT Movie, Budget, Gross 
FROM MOVIE 
WHERE Country = 'USA' 
ORDER BY Gross DESC 
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY; 

 
SELECT Movie, Budget, Gross 
FROM MOVIE 
WHERE Country <> 'USA' 
ORDER BY Gross DESC 
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY; 

 

SELECT MOVIE.Movie, DIRECTOR.D_FirstName ||' '|| DIRECTOR.D_MiddleName ||' '|| DIRECTOR.D_LastName AS DirectorName, MOVIE.Gross 
FROM MOVIE JOIN DIRECTOR ON MOVIE.MovieID=DIRECTOR.MovieID  
WHERE Country = 'USA'  
ORDER BY MOVIE.Gross DESC  
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;

FROM MOVIE JOIN DIRECTOR ON MOVIE.MovieID=DIRECTOR.MovieID  
WHERE Country <> 'USA'  
ORDER BY MOVIE.Gross DESC  
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;  


2. Which genre has the highest average score? ( took genre from movie table and calculated averages using aggregate function to find the movie genre with the highest average ratings. Ordered them in order from highest to lowest and fetched the top genre)

SELECT GENRE, ROUND(AVG(SCORE), 2) AS MAXAVGSCORE 
FROM MOVIE 
GROUP BY GENRE 
ORDER BY MAXAVGSCORE DESC 
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY 



3. If the budget is higher, do they get better ratings? Direct correlation? 
(showing a query ordering by budget and then by score to show the comparison between the two. Highest budget does not necessarily mean highest score, one of the highest scoring movies has a fairly small budget compared to others) 

SELECT Movie, ROUND(Budget, '$999,999,999') AS Budget, Score 
FROM MOVIE 
ORDER BY Budget DESC; 

 

SELECT Movie, ROUND(Budget, '$999,999,999') AS Budget, Score 
FROM MOVIE 
ORDER BY Score DESC;

JOIN COMPANY ON MOVIE.MovieID=COMPANY.MovieID 
WHERE Country = 'USA'  
INTERSECT  
SELECT MOVIE.Movie, DIRECTOR.D_FirstName ||''|| DIRECTOR.D_MiddleName ||''|| DIRECTOR.D_LastName AS DirectorName, COMPANY.Company
